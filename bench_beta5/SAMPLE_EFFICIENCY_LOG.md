# PPO sample-efficiency optimization log

Tracks the ongoing hypothesis loop comparing `relayrl_algorithms`' PPO against Sample
Factory's APPO on the matched EnvPool `LunarLander-v2` setup (512 envs, see
`scripts/sf_lunar_bench.py` and `src/bin/bench_lunar_ppo_tch.rs`). Each entry records a
hypothesis, the change, results (averaged over N runs), and accept/reject.

Metric definitions:
- **final**: last printed `MeanReturn` (RelayRL) / `Avg episode reward` (SF) of the run.
- **AUC**: average of the metric sampled at 10 proportional points
  `[480,720,960,1200,1440,1680,1920,2160,2400,2640] / 2832` of the run's total epoch count
  (fractions ≈ 0.169–0.932), i.e. a proxy for "area under the learning curve" /
  time-to-convergence over the bulk of training.

## Baseline (EnvPool 512-env, both frameworks)

Both RelayRL and SF use a single shared `envpool.make("LunarLander-v2", num_envs=512,
max_episode_steps=500, seed=1)` instance; hyperparameters matched per
`scripts/sf_lunar_bench.py`'s module docstring.

| | final (avg of 5) | AUC (avg of 5) | env-frames/sec | wall/run |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| RelayRL (independent PPO, kernel.rs) | 141.02 | 93.54 | ≈39,664 | ≈972.6 s |
| Sample Factory (APPO) | 185.88 | 178.64 | ≈27,430 | ≈1400.2 s |

RelayRL is ~1.44x faster in raw env-frame throughput, but SF reaches ~155-166 reward within
the first ~17% of the budget — already exceeding RelayRL's *final* return after the full
budget. This per-frame sample-efficiency gap is the target of the loop.

## Hypothesis 1: rollout-chunked GAE with bootstrap (REJECTED, rolled back)

**Idea**: `replay_buffer.rs::insert_trajectory` only pushes an `episode_boundaries` entry when
`action.get_done()` is true (true env episode end). Rollout-length cutoffs (`rollout_len=90`,
`trajectory.set_truncated()` called in `training/mod.rs` but with the *last action's*
`done=false`) never create a boundary — those ~90-step chunks sit in the buffer with zero
advantage/return until the *true* episode (up to 500 steps) eventually ends, at which point
ONE large `episode_boundaries` entry covers the whole true episode (bootstrap=0, natural
termination). This differs from SF, which computes bootstrapped GAE over fixed 90-step
rollout chunks every epoch.

**Change** (`replay_buffer.rs`):
1. `insert_trajectory`: push an `episode_boundaries` entry on the *last* action of a
   trajectory when `action.get_done() || trajectory.is_truncated` (covers rollout-length
   cutoffs too), not just `action.get_done()`.
2. Fixed a latent bug this exposed: bootstrap value was read as `values[end-1]`
   (duplicating the chunk's last value) instead of `values[end]` (the true next-state
   value `V(s_end)`), in `finalize_and_drain_blocking`, `finalize_and_drain_first_n_blocking`,
   and `finalize_gae_blocking`.
3. Fixed dead code: `insert_trajectory` read `map.get("value")` but the key pushed by
   `training/mod.rs` is `"val"` — `buffers.values` was always 0.0 at insert time (inert for
   the `[0,cut_step)` range since `finalize_and_drain_first_n_blocking` overwrites it with
   fresh `value_forward` output, but left `values[cut_step]`, the last boundary's bootstrap
   target, stale at 0.0).

**Results**:
- Naive version (#1 only): final=154.3, AUC=49.55 (n=1) — AUC well below the entire baseline
  range (73.2–108.5). The newly-frequent bootstrap (`values[end-1]`) bias dominated.
- Corrected version (#1+#2+#3, n=3): final = [141.3, 123.5, 139.1] avg **134.63**;
  AUC = [80.65, 97.76, 79.30] avg **85.90**. Both slightly below baseline (141.02 / 93.54),
  within baseline's run-to-run noise band but with no improvement. Throughput dropped
  ~14% (≈34,000 vs ≈39,664 env-frames/sec) from the extra per-chunk GAE bookkeeping
  (`episode_boundaries` now has ~512 entries/epoch instead of a handful).

**Verdict**: REJECTED, rolled back via `git checkout`. No net diff vs baseline.

**Takeaway for future hypotheses**: RelayRL's existing full-true-episode GAE (bootstrap=0 at
natural termination, no mid-episode chunking bias) is *not* the bottleneck — it may in fact be
a more accurate advantage estimate than SF's chunked-bootstrap approach. The ~2x sample-
efficiency gap vs SF likely lies elsewhere: minibatch/epoch cadence semantics
(`episodes_needed_for_steps` vs SF's fixed 90-step rollout), advantage/return normalization
scope (per-batch vs SF's running normalizer), value-loss weighting/clipping differences,
policy/value network initialization, or LR schedule interaction with `train_pi_iters=4`
sequential (unshuffled) minibatch passes.
