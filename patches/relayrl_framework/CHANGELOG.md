# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.5.0-beta.2] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- **Actor environment control API** - `RelayRLActorEnv` adds `run_env`, `set_env`, `remove_env`, `get_env_count`, and `set_env_count` so local actors can manage scalar and vector environment lifecycles through the coordinator
- **Batched local inference routing** - `RequestInferenceBatch` and `BatchedInferenceRequest` add batched observation dispatch for vectorized local environments
  - `FlagLastInference` now carries optional `env_id` and `env_label` so finalized trajectories can preserve environment identity across batched runs

### Changed
- **Environment trait alignment** - `relayrl_framework` now inherits `relayrl_env_trait` from the workspace and targets the 1.1 environment API surface used by the new actor environment plumbing
- **Runtime routing and vectorized environment handling** - Coordinator, state-manager, and router paths were reworked around shared router state, batched environment execution, and explicit routing timeouts for `RequestInferenceBatch` and `FlagLastInference`
- **Hot-path runtime optimizations** - Cache padding and ordering refinements were applied across shared actor counts, router flags, backpressure permits, circuit-breaker counters, and shutdown state to reduce contention and improve responsiveness under load

### Fixed
- **Action request coordination** - `request_action()` now acquires shared dispatcher and valid-id state in one path and tightens the routing window to reduce actor reply races
- **Runtime ordering and recovery behavior** - Actor distribution/removal ordering, backpressure wakeups, and circuit-breaker state transitions were tightened to behave more predictably under load

### Breaking
- **Environment integration surface** - Consumers integrating custom environments must adapt to the newer `relayrl_env_trait` 1.1 generics and method requirements now used by framework environment APIs
  - Projects that pinned `relayrl_env_trait` `1.0.x` alongside `0.5.0-beta.1` need to align with the workspace-managed env-trait dependency before moving to `0.5.0-beta.2`

## [0.5.0-beta.1] - 2026-04-13

### Added
- **In-memory trajectory retrieval** - `RelayRLAgent::get_trajectory_memory()` added for draining accumulated per-actor trajectory memory from the runtime coordinator
  - Completed trajectories can now be retained in bounded in-memory buffers, and `flag_last_action` now stamps each emitted trajectory with an episode id before dispatch
- **Overflow inference mode** - `ActorInferenceMode::ServerOverflow(ModelMode, InferenceParams)` added as an experimental transport-gated mode for mixing local model ownership with remote inference fallback

### Changed
- **Local model/runtime concurrency** - Local actor model handles now use `ArcSwapOption` instead of lock-based storage so inference and model swaps can proceed through snapshot-style loads rather than blocking reload paths

### Fixed
- **Action request handling** - `request_action()` follow-up fixes improved actor reply coordination and corrected id/reference handling in the runtime action path
- **Trajectory-length defaults** - Generated config JSON and builder defaults now cap `max_traj_length` at `1000` instead of `100000000` to avoid runaway memory use in default configurations

### Breaking
- **Feature and codec surface** - Default features dropped `tch-backend`, `relayrl_framework` no longer forces `relayrl_types` `ndarray-backend` / `onnx-model` features in its dependency declaration, and `prelude::config::network_codec` now exists only when `nats-transport` or `zmq-transport` is enabled
- **Training-data mode API redesign** - `ActorTrainingDataMode` was expanded from the older `Offline` / `Hybrid` shape into explicit file and memory variants such as `OfflineWithFiles`, `OfflineWithMemory`, `OnlineWithFiles`, and `OnlineWithMemory`; the non-transport default is now `OfflineWithMemory`

## [0.5.0-beta] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- **Local model update API** - `RelayRLAgent::update_model(model, actor_ids: Option<Vec<ActorUuid>>)` added for refreshing all actors or targeted actors; validates `ModelModule` metadata before dispatch and rejects local updates when `ActorTrainingDataMode` is `Online` or `Hybrid`
- **Observability configuration** - `ClientConfigParams` and generated client config JSON now include `metrics_meter_name` and `metrics_otlp_endpoint`; metrics initialization is bound to live config state and Prometheus/OTLP exporter plumbing is threaded through the client runtime
- **Algorithm and environment prelude re-exports** - Framework prelude now exposes `relayrl_algorithms` and `relayrl_env_trait` via `prelude::algorithms`, `prelude::templates::algorithms`, and `prelude::templates::environment`
- **Expanded client test coverage** - Added `tests/local_client_smoke.rs` for a TorchScript-backed build/start/request/shutdown path and broadened unit coverage across agent, configuration, file sink, metrics, router, and lifecycle modules
- **Transport model-listener stop hooks** - `stop_model_listener()` added across sync/async transport traits, dispatcher paths, and ZMQ/NATS implementations to support explicit listener shutdown during runtime teardown

### Changed
- **Beta support contract** - `README.md`, crate docs, and client module docs now define `0.5.0-beta` as the local/default client runtime release; `zmq-transport`, `nats-transport`, and server-backed workflows are documented as experimental
- **Feature defaults and docs.rs surface** - Default features changed to `["client", "tch-backend", "metrics", "logging"]`; docs.rs feature coverage expanded, and transports now opt in separately instead of being enabled by default
- **Dependency and feature wiring** - `relayrl_algorithms`, `relayrl_env_trait`, and `generic-array` added; `relayrl_types/codec-full` moved behind `zmq-transport` / `nats-transport`; `tokio-stream` made optional under `nats-transport`; `async-nats` bumped to 0.47.0; `opentelemetry-otlp` bumped to 0.31.1 with `grpc-tonic`; dev dependencies now use `tch`, `burn-ndarray`, and `burn-tch` while `gym` was removed
- **Agent startup and transport params** - `RelayRLAgent::start()` / `restart()` now consume `AgentStartParameters<B>`; `AgentBuilder` stores `ClientModes` directly instead of `Option<ClientModes>`; `InferenceParams` / `TrainingParams` now derive `Default`, and `TrainingParams` is available whenever either transport feature is enabled
- **Runtime coordination and routing** - Coordinator, lifecycle, state, scale, actor, buffer, receiver, filter, and router dispatcher paths were reworked for shared router state, receiver-to-router dispatch, actor-count/max-traj-length-driven semaphore backpressure, tighter model-version routing, and the move of `router_dispatcher` into `runtime/router/`
- **Experimental transport behavior** - ZMQ and NATS model-listener behavior was aligned around persistent listening, explicit shutdown, and model-version propagation; transport dispatch now coordinates model update routing and cleanup more consistently across both backends
- **Observability runtime plumbing** - Metrics manager state is now rebound from config and threaded through coordinator, actor, scale, state, dispatcher, retry, and exporter paths; logging was simplified around a smaller `log4rs`-based module and broad `println!`/`eprintln!` usage was replaced with `log` macros
- **Docs, examples, and assets** - Quick-start examples now use the beta import paths and `agent.start(params)` pattern; the example server model metadata and artifact were renamed from `client_model.pt` to `server_model.pt`

### Removed
- **Legacy network presets** - Removed `full-zmq-network`, `zmq-training-network`, `zmq-inference-network`, `full-nats-network`, `nats-training-network`, `nats-inference-network`, and the old `*-training-server` / `*-inference-server` feature flags from `Cargo.toml`
- **In-crate templates and tokio utility module** - The old framework `templates` module was dropped in favor of external prelude re-exports from `relayrl_env_trait` / `relayrl_algorithms`, and `utilities::tokio` was removed from the crate
- **Legacy logging helpers and runtime statistics stub** - Deleted the old logging builder/filter/sink submodules and removed the placeholder `RelayRLAgent::runtime_statistics()` API

### Fixed
- **Configuration schema and defaults** - Corrected `hyperparameter_args` naming, renamed default transport JSON keys to `*_address`, changed the default local trajectory output type to valid `Csv`, added default metrics fields, and corrected the default training server model name to `training_server_model`
- **Local trajectory directory handling** - `LocalTrajectoryFileParams::new()` now retries directory creation, verifies that the resolved path is actually a directory, and `Default` no longer assumes validation cannot fail
- **Config hot-reload behavior** - Lifecycle polling now rebuilds its interval only when `config_update_polling_seconds` changes, uses a unified `handle_config_change()` path, and keeps shared `max_traj_length` state synchronized as configuration updates are applied
- **Shutdown and listener cleanup** - Actor shutdown now surfaces timeout failures more cleanly, and transport/model listeners can be stopped explicitly during receiver shutdown instead of depending on best-effort teardown
- **Metrics exporter rebinding and gated builds** - Prometheus collector reuse, OTLP provider rebinding, docs.rs compilation, and transport-specific feature-gated builds were tightened across metrics and transport codepaths

### Breaking
- Default features changed from `["client", "zmq-transport", "nats-transport"]` to `["client", "tch-backend", "metrics", "logging"]`; consumers must now opt into `zmq-transport` or `nats-transport` explicitly
- Feature flags renamed/removed: legacy network presets and `zmq-training-server` / `zmq-inference-server` / `nats-training-server` / `nats-inference-server` were removed in favor of explicit transport flags plus `training-server` / `inference-server`
- `RelayRLAgent::start()` / `restart()` now take `AgentStartParameters<B>` instead of the previous positional argument lists
- `AgentBuilder::client_modes` is no longer `Option<ClientModes>`
- Prelude imports moved from flat `prelude::{tensor,action,trajectory,model,templates}` exports to `prelude::types::*`, `prelude::algorithms`, and `prelude::templates::{algorithms,environment}`; the in-crate `templates` module is gone
- `RuntimeStatisticsReturnType` is now gated behind `metrics` or `logging`, and the placeholder `runtime_statistics()` API was removed
- `ClientError` is no longer `#[non_exhaustive]`, and new variants were added for model validation and local model update support
- `TransportConfigParams::max_traj_length` and related builder setters now use `usize` instead of `u128`
- Generated/default config JSON changed shape: transport keys now use `*_address` names, metrics fields were added, `trajectory_file_output.file_type` defaults to `Csv`, and the example server model filename changed to `server_model.pt`

## [0.5.0-alpha.3] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- **NATS Implementation** - Full NATS transport implementation replacing alpha.2 stubs; `nats/ops.rs` added (~1459 lines); `nats/interface.rs` and `nats/policies.rs` substantially completed with working send/receive logic, stream handling, and authentication policy enforcement

- **`is_local_file_writing_enabled` helper** - Crate-level helper on `RelayRLAgent` to query whether local file writing is active

### Changed
- **NATS `SharedTransportAddresses` init** - `lifecycle_manager.rs` updated to properly initialize `SharedTransportAddresses` when constructing a NATS transport client
- **Transport dispatcher param ownership** - `send_client_ids` and `send_inference_model_init_request` parameters changed from references to owned values

- **Example config NATS addresses** - All three example configs updated to include the NATS address namespace
- **`async_trait` on async transport traits** - `#[async_trait]` applied uniformly across async transport traits in `transport_sink`

### Fixed
- **Feature flag compilation** - Resolved compilation errors under `client` and `client zmq-transport` feature flag selections across `coordinator.rs`, `scale_manager.rs`, `transport_sink/mod.rs`, `zmq/ops.rs`, and `router/buffer.rs`
- **Trailing comma in example configs** - Stray JSON trailing comma removed from all three example configs and `configuration.rs` that would have caused config parsing failures at runtime

- **Workspace dependency hierarchy** - Dependency versions and shared crates (e.g. `relayrl_types`, `tokio`, `serde`, `burn-tensor`, `arrow`, etc.) reworked in root [Cargo.toml](Cargo.toml) via `[workspace.dependencies]`; framework crate uses `relayrl_types = { workspace = true, ... }` and other workspace-inherited deps
- **ZMQ ops** - Removed `unwrap`/`expect` in [crates/relayrl_framework/src/network/client/runtime/data/transport_sink/zmq/ops.rs](crates/relayrl_framework/src/network/client/runtime/data/transport_sink/zmq/ops.rs); errors now propagated via `Result` and `map_err` where appropriate

### Added
- **NATS scaffolding** - Additional scaffold for NATS transport: [nats/policies.rs](crates/relayrl_framework/src/network/client/runtime/data/transport_sink/nats/policies.rs) placeholder (`NatsAuthentication`); [nats/interface.rs](crates/relayrl_framework/src/network/client/runtime/data/transport_sink/nats/interface.rs) implements `AsyncClientTransportInterface`, `AsyncClientScalingTransportOps`, `AsyncClientInferenceTransportOps`, and related execution traits with stub method bodies ready for implementation

---

- **Default Features** - Changed from `["client"]` to `["client", "zmq-transport"]`
- **Scaling System Rewrite** - `scale_in`/`scale_out` major rewrite; bare UUID args replaced with pool entries `(namespace, context, uuid)`; scaling protocol permits with backpressure; parallel scaling operations

- **Server Addresses** - `server_addresses` renamed to `transport_addresses` / `SharedTransportAddresses`; split into `SharedInferenceAddresses` and `SharedTrainingAddresses`; address prefix system removed
- **Dependencies to Workspace** - `relayrl_types`, `tokio`, `serde`, `dashmap`, `thiserror`, `async-trait`, `burn-tensor`, `arrow`, `arrow-schema`, `arrow-array` now use workspace inheritance
